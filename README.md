# homebridge-viewsonic-projector

Homebridge plugin for ViewSonic projectors via serial RS232 as HomeKit TVs. Requires iOS >=12.2 and homebridge >=0.4.46.

This plugin connects to a ViewSonic projector via serial RS232. Developed and tested using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a USB to serial RS232 cable to connect to a ViewSonic PX701HD. For now, **it only manage power ON / OFF**

## Deep Dive

This projector have a strange behaviour, when the **power is off** it use string values to interact (`pow=?`, `pow=on`, ...), but when the **power is on** we can only use the hexadecimal communication (`06 14 00 04 00 34 12 00 00 5E`) as mention in the documentation.

- Note: Updagrading the projector firmware to v1.01 does not improve the rs-232 communication

Special thanks to the [homebridge-benq-projector](https://github.com/solowalker27/homebridge-benq-projector) plugin, on which this one is very inspired.

## TODO

- [x] Manager power on and power off (+ check status)
- [ ] Plublish NPM package (for auto installation)
- [ ] Handle input management (check status, change to hdmi1/hdmi2/...)
- [ ] Handle eco mode (check status, changetto Eco/Dynamic Eco/Super√âco+,Normal)
